The Wasserburgruine Friedewald is a medieval water castle ruin located near Friedewald in the Hessian Rhön region. The ruins sit in a scenic valley setting, surrounded by ponds and meadows that once formed the castle's defensive water system.

The site offers peaceful hiking opportunities and historical exploration, with remaining walls and foundations telling the story of this once-important medieval fortification that controlled the trade routes through the Rhön Mountains.
