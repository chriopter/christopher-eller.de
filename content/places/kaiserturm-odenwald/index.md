The Kaiserturm is a 34-meter observation tower built in 1906-1907 on the Neunkircher Höhe (605m), the highest elevation in the Hessian Odenwald. Built in memory of Emperor William I, it replaced an earlier tower destroyed by a storm in 1904.

The tower features the Odenwald's "highest pub" and offers panoramic views from the summit. It can only be climbed when the restaurant is open. The location serves as a crossing point for European long-distance hiking paths E1 and E8.
