Burgfeste Dilsberg is a ruined 12th-century castle built by the counts of Lauffen, offering sweeping 360째 views of the Neckar valley and Odenwald forest. The castle features a 46-meter deep well and a remarkable 78-meter underground tunnel system.

Visited by Mark Twain in the 1870s and described in "A Tramp Abroad," the castle provides some of the best panoramic views in the region from its prominent hilltop position overlooking the picturesque town of Neckargem체nd.
