Festung Breuberg is one of the best-preserved castles in southern Germany, dating from the 12th century. The castle features an impressive 85-metre-deep well, which is a highlight of every guided tour.

Today the castle houses a small museum, castle tavern, and youth hostel. The castle grounds are freely accessible year-round, while museum visits are only possible through guided tours organized by the Breuberg city administration (open mid-March to mid-October).
