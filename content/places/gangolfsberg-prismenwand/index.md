The Gangolfsberg Prismenwand features spectacular columnar basalt formations - natural hexagonal rock columns created by volcanic cooling processes. These impressive geological structures are among the finest examples of basalt columns in the Rhön region.

The dramatic rock wall showcases the power of volcanic geology, with perfectly formed prismatic columns that create a striking natural monument. The site offers excellent opportunities for geological study and photography of these remarkable volcanic formations.
