The Nibelungentour is a challenging day hike connecting Reichelsheim and Lindenfels via sections of the famous Nibelungensteig trail. Starting from the old town hall (Altes Rathaus) in Reichelsheim (built in 1554), the 19.7 km trail leads through Heidenberg (330m), Klößbuckel (367m), Range (410m), and Stotz (478m) to Gumpener Kreuz.

The route continues westward to Lindenfels, featuring the impressive Burg Lindenfels ruins (mentioned in 11th-century documents) and the Bismarckwarte viewpoint. Plan approximately 5 hours for this scenic hike through the heart of the Odenwald.
