Laacher See is a large volcanic crater lake (caldera) in the Eifel region, formed by a massive volcanic eruption 12,900 years ago. The lake is surrounded by hiking trails and features the historic Maria Laach Abbey on its shores.

The area offers excellent hiking, cycling, and nature observation opportunities. Visitors can explore the abbey's gardens, walk around the lake, and observe the still-active volcanic gas bubbles rising from the lake's depths.
