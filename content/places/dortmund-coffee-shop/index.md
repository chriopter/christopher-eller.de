This cozy coffee shop in Berlin offers some of the best espresso in the city. Located in a quiet neighborhood away from the typical tourist areas, it's a perfect spot to relax and watch the locals go about their day.

## The Coffee

Their house blend is sourced from small farms in Ethiopia and Colombia, roasted on-site weekly. The baristas are highly skilled and take pride in their latte art.

## What to Try

Don't miss their signature cardamom bun - it pairs perfectly with a flat white.

## When to Visit

Weekday mornings are quiet and perfect for working or reading. Weekend afternoons tend to be busy with locals.
