Grube Clara is a former baryte and fluorite mine in the Black Forest, now famous for its mineral collecting opportunities. The mine's waste heaps (Mineralienhalde) contain beautiful specimens of fluorite, baryte, and other minerals.

Visitors can search for crystals and minerals on the accessible portions of the mine dumps. The area is popular with mineral collectors and geology enthusiasts who come to find specimens of the colorful fluorite crystals and other minerals for which the mine was historically known.
