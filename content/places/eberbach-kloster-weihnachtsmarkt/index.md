The Eberbacher Weihnacht is a small, intimate Christmas market held at the historic Kloster Eberbach monastery on the second and third Advent weekends. Located directly in front of the monastery with views of the imposing basilica and festively illuminated Christmas tree.

The market features special handicrafts, fine spirits, jams, chutneys, ceramic art and decorations, along with delicacies and wines from the Kloster Eberbach winery. This peaceful alternative to busy Christmas markets offers a contemplative atmosphere for visitors seeking inspiration and rest.
