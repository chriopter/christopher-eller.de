In my childhood, scientist and especially physicist were heroes. The pictures of Apollo 11, Viking or Hubble where astonishing to me. We were literally reaching to the stars.

With admiration of engineering documentation for kids explained German engineering from the present and the possible future. Like our ICE and Maglev systems.

Yes, there where discussions about environment and potential problems but it was always with a solution in mind, with something better that doesnt even come with that particular problem.

There was a prosperous and bright future of a better world right at our fingertips.

The same state-backed TV channels I viewed this as child have replaced the dreamers with moral de-growther.

The "known TV physicist" we have here literally advocates for _less_ space travel. Advocates for _less_ technology. Literally advocates for _less_ energy. Does not praise engineering marvels on trains but advocates for bike zones as answer to the climate change.

I find Copenhagen nice, too. But it is literally insane that a physicist does not inspires us to reach for the stars and instead chooses to get onto TV to speculate about bike zones concepts of municipalities. Thats it?

We look into whats next and only see the bad. But we cant even know for sure.

We literally manage the decay instead of celebrating the future.

We used to dream.
