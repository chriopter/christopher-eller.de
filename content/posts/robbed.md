They are robbing you in broad daylight. They tell you only those with the right parent household make it. They tell you that statistically you are not going to make it. That your heritage, your race, or your gender will hinder you. That there are great hidden powers, the wealthy, the powerful, robbing you and you have no chance.

You shall be miserable and fulfill the prophecy of having no chance. They are robbing you of your own agency.

It's all cope from those who want to be miserable and want others to be miserable. If you live in the West, you already have an unbelievable privilege, and no eat-the-rich rhetoric in this world can take it from you. 

Why is it always the ones who are already well off telling others that they are hopelessly disadvantaged?

If you do things, the world will form around you and a rising tide will lift you. There is no other option, even if you believe the cope - you should absolutely want the next generation to have it better.
