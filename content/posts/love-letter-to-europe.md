title: Loveletter to Europe

Europe is the greatest project of mankind. Dozens of completely different states, cultures and languages tied together by shared values and peace.

The fact that I as a German can visit Verdun and Douaumont not only being allowed to at all but being welcomed by our French neighbors like a guest is a miracle that still feels unbelievable to me.
\And not just there. Whether in Poland, Italy, Czechia or Denmark I have only met the friendliest people with no prejudices whatsoever.

If we ever fumble this we Germans shall be damned forever.
